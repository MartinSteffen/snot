1.) 
Snot is a project of some students at the CAU (Christian Albrechts
University in Kiel, Germany). It was developed during the summer term
2001. The programm deals with SFCs (Sequebntial Function Charts). You
can create a SFC in the editor, parse it from a .tsfc file, check if
it is correct, simulate it  and translate it to SMV.


2.)
Snot deals with sessions and SFCs.
A session includes one or many SFCs. There is no SFC without a
session. You always have to create or open a session before you can
start working.

Starting Snot the Programm offers two options:
  - Loading an existing session, or
  - Creating a new empty session.


The menu structure:
  Session:
   "New Session" opens a new session
   "Open Session" opens an existing session
   "Close Session" closes a session
	
   "Save Session" saves the session with tho old name
   "Save Session As" saves it with a new name
   "Exit Snot" exits Snot

  SFC:
   "New SFC" creates a new empty SFC an shows the Editor
   "Import SFC" imports an exported SFC into the session
   "Export SFC" exports and saves an SFC.
   "Rename SFC" renames the SFC
   "Remove SFC" removes the SFC from the session
   "Import Example1" imports an Example

  Tools:
   "Editor" starts an editor with a new SFC
   "Check SFC" checks the SFC
   "Simulator" simulates the SFC at standard out.
   "SMV" translates the SFC to SMV and saves it to the disk
   "Parser" parses a SFC from disk
   "Pretty Printer"
	
  View:
   "SFC-Browser" shows or disables the SFC-Browser window
   "Tool Bar" shows or disables the tools toolbar
   "Files toolbar" shows or disables the files toolbar

The SFC-Browser:
In the SFC-Browser all SFCs in the session are listed.
- A single click sets this SFC as the active SFC. Now it can be checked
or simulated..

- A doubleclick sets this SFC as the active SFC and displays it in an
editor window.

Note: 
Not all SFCs must be displayed in an editor. For example the
parsed SFCs. So by doubleclicking on an SFC in the list you are
sometimes asked if you wish to create an editor for this SFC. If you
want to do so click yes, but be aware, that the editor sometimes may
not be able to deal with these SFCs.

Once you have an SFC (which has been checked and is working correctly) you can press the SMV button, the SFC will then be translated into the input language used by the SMV model checker (see www.cadence.com for a free Windows version). 
If everything works fine you can save the resulting code into a file which can be loaded (or entered manually) by the model checker tool.With this model checker (not supplied) it is possible (depending on the software you use) to check certain properties of the SMV code or even to prove correctness for the whole.We hope that all properties and invariants of the SFC still hold after translation to SMV but unfortunatetly we cannot guarantee this.So don't use this tool for nuclear power plants or any other sensible fields ;) as long as you haven't proven correctness of the translator.The SMV code variable names refer to the original SFC names and should be pretty self-explanatory, so check it out. Good luck.

7.)
When you have build an SFC and you want to translate it or simulate
it, you have to check it first. By pressing the CHECK-Button you
activate the integrated checker, which checks the whole SFC.
